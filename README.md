# Release Watcher

Watches new releases and sends notification when they're available.

Currently supports fetching releases from:

- [GitHub](https://github.com)
- [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com)
- [PyPI](https://pypi.org)
- [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com)
- [Helm Hub](https://hub.helm.sh)

Currently supports notifications to:

- [Slack](https://slack.com)

The application periodically checks the target projects using their provider, and sends out a notificiation with some details about new releases when it finds them. Previously seen releases are kept in a [SQLite](TODO) database.

## Usage

With Docker:

```shell
$ docker run -d --name release-watcher 				\
	-v $PWD/release-watcher.yml:/var/conf/releases.yml:ro 	\
	-v $PWD/data:/data 					\
	-e CONFIGURATION_FILE=/var/conf/releases.yml 		\
	-e DATABASE_PATH=/data/releases.db			\
	-e SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://some.slack.webhook.url	\
	rycus86/release-watcher
```

Alternatively, build with Go (tested on version 1.10, 1.14, 1.16), then execute:

```shell
$ export DATABASE_PATH=$PWD/releases.db
$ export SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://some.slack.webhook.url
$ ./release-watcher
```

## Configuration

The application needs the target projects to be defined in a *YAML* configuration file. An example would be:

```yaml
releases:
  github:
    - owner: docker
      repo: docker-py

  dockerhub:
    - repo: nginx
    - owner: rycus86
      repo: grafana

  pypi:
    - name: flask

  jetbrains:
    - name: go
      alias: GoLand

  helmhub:
    - repo: bitnami
      chart: airflow

  artifacthub:
    - owner: bitnami
      chart: postgresql

```

The root `releases` holds mappings, keyed by the provider name, and the value being a list of project configurations. The available providers and their related configuration is listed below.

Each project can also have a `filter` property, which is a regular expression for whitelisting which releases to notify for. This defaults to `^[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+$`, so it would match `1.2.3`, but not `1.2.3-rc1` for example.

### GitHub

The `github` provider looks for GitHub releases. The configuration items need to have an `owner` and `repo` property.

This provider accepts some optional configuration parameters, either from environment variables, or a key-value file at `/var/secrets/github` in `KEY=VALUE` format on each line.

| Key | Description | Default |
| --- | ----------- | ------- |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | The GitHub OAuth token if you wish to make authenticated API calls, to get better rate-limiting. ([token generation](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) - no scopes are needed) | - |
| `GITHUB_USERNAME` | The GitHub username for basic authentication instead of Oauth with token | - |
| `GITHUB_PASSWORD` | The GitHub password for the username | - |
| `HTTP_TIMEOUT` | The HTTP timeout for API calls | `30s` |

### Docker Hub

The `dockerhub` provider looks for new image tags on Docker Hub. The configuration items need to have a `repo` property and usually an `owner`, which defaults to `library` if omitted.

### Artifact Hub

The `artifacthub` provider looks for new Helm chart versions. The configuration items need to have a `repo` property and a `chart`.

This provider accepts some optional configuration parameters, either from environment variables, or a key-value file at `/var/secrets/artifacthub` in `KEY=VALUE` format on each line.

| --- | ----------- | ------- |
| `HTTP_TIMEOUT` | The HTTP timeout for API calls | `30s` |

### Helm Hub (deprecated)

The `helmhub` provider looks for new Helm chart versions. The configuration items need to have a `repo` property and a `chart`. This provider is replaced by `artifacthub`

This provider accepts some optional configuration parameters, either from environment variables, or a key-value file at `/var/secrets/helmhub` in `KEY=VALUE` format on each line.
